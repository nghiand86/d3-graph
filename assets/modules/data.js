This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver both economic gains and more inclusive societies.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Mireia Giné, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, University of Navarra.",

While digital technologies have the potential to enable new value for everyone, they risk further exacerbating exclusion, the unequal concentration of power and wealth, and social instability. Companies must use digital infrastructure and data to collaborate, develop innovative business models, navigate disruption, and transition to a new normal - post-pandemic, purpose-driven, sustainable, and inclusive.",

                        "description": "Geopolitics has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War. The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

Overall, a general dilution of hierarchies is underway amid growing tension between the local and the global - as digitalization reshuffles the traditional logic of power. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Antoine Vergne, Director of Strategic Partnerships at Missions Publiques",

This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver both economic gains and more inclusive societies.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Mireia Giné, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, University of Navarra.",

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

Weather extremes related to the climate crisis are already causing crop losses and serious damage to infrastructure. Some insurers have responded by reducing their risk exposure to flooding, wildfires, and other climate-related disasters, despite a lingering insurance gap between industrialized and developing countries.

While the term was first coined in 1990, geo-economic rivalries did not fully emerge until after the 2008 financial crisis. Particularly since about 2014, countries have refined the use of economic tools to attain their geopolitical objectives and weaken rivals; some analysts have characterized this as the “weaponization of interdependence.” This exposes civilian populations to increasing related pressures, and multinational corporations and banks have had to adapt to heightened related risks. Global stakeholders should think about how to best contain geo-economic tensions, in the interest of more effective international cooperation on matters like the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and migration.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Nicholas Mulder, Assistant Professor at Cornell University.",

While some individual rankings may appear unusually high or low, that can merely be the result of a large number of peers having identical progress scores in a particular category - which may group them into a single ranking at one end of the spectrum.",

In order to make that happen, however, trillions will first have to be invested in the rollout of global 5G networks (which may be delayed in some cases due to COVID-19). Greater cooperation is needed to foster deployment; when used to power the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data, 5G can deliver significant social value. One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone. While several countries have initiated roadmaps for 5G rollout, others are falling behind - partly due to the lack of alignment among policy-makers, regulators and the private sector.",

One key underlying factor has been the increased prevalence since the 1970s of neoliberalism and the financialization of everything - resulting in a de-democratization of economic policy-making. Yet, inequality is not solely about income; inequalities in terms of health, age, (dis)ability, gender, technology access, infrastructure, and geographical location have all been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitigating inequality will now demand a mix of bottom-up and top-down changes that recognize the social and economic systems aggravating inequality are a matter of choice.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Professor Henrietta L.

Material goods sitting in stores once defined the market, but people now expect more. The wealthy are seeking out luxury experiences and spending heavily on long-term investments like education and retirement, while many members of the global middle class (who are now as likely to come from Mumbai as Minnesota) are seeking out goods that reflect their personal values - even as much of their spending has been limited by wage stagnation.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, Professor and James Irvine Chair in Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Southern California (USC).",

This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver both economic gains and more inclusive societies.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Mireia Giné, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, University of Navarra.",

Material goods sitting in stores once defined the market, but people now expect more. The wealthy are seeking out luxury experiences and spending heavily on long-term investments like education and retirement, while many members of the global middle class (who are now as likely to come from Mumbai as Minnesota) are seeking out goods that reflect their personal values - even as much of their spending has been limited by wage stagnation.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, Professor and James Irvine Chair in Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Southern California (USC).",

To help the country tackle these challenges, the government has implemented policies and reforms aimed at spurring innovation and more sustainable economic growth.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with the Korea Development Institute (KDI).",

There is no single definition that can adequately capture all the manifestations of corruption, and there has been a paradigm shift in terms of the fight against it - which takes place increasingly through multi-stakeholder collaboration, collective action initiatives specific to particular sectors, the use of new technology, a more expansive “stakeholder” approach to capitalism, better assessing gender implications, and elevating public awareness. Fighting corruption in all of its forms will be essential for truly sustainable development.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and is curated in partnership with Pawan Kumar Sinha, Director of Academic Programmes at the International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA).",

In 2016 the concentration crossed 400 parts per million, and - despite recent progress in decarbonizing the world’s energy systems - has been increasing steadily by about two parts per year. The Paris Agreement on climate change aims to limit warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, by having countries voluntarily reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of punishing environmental impact if emissions are not curtailed sufficiently to prevent even 1.5°C of warming.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Yale University.",

By November 2021 there were about 250 million confirmed cases globally and more than five million recorded deaths - though the actual death toll may be significantly higher. As the pandemic has spread it has stirred anxiety and snarled supply chains, overwhelmed health systems, and triggered potentially lasting geopolitical change. Vaccines have become widely-available in wealthier countries while others have mostly gone without, and half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the crisis. Around the world, desperate efforts are underway to fully contain what has become a profoundly disruptive outbreak.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Rebecca Katz, Director, Center for Global Health Science and Security, Ellie Graeden, Associate Professor (Adjunct), Alexandra Phelan, Assistant Professor, and Colin Carlson, Assistant Research Professor, at Georgetown University.",

As governments and businesses survey the damage inflicted by COVID-19, strategic foresight is more important than ever. Increasing social fragmentation and emerging risks to human health, rising unemployment, a widening digital divide, and youth disillusionment can have severe consequences. The gap between the haves and have nots will widen further if access to digital tools and skills remains unequal, and young people are now under exceptional pressure - many are facing their second global crisis in slightly more than a decade, and an elevated risk of missing out on opportunities.

Emigration and immigration provide tremendous opportunities, though there are challenges tied to integration, social cohesion, labour, and border management. Now, COVID-19 is placing tremendous pressure on migration and mobility systems - as well as on migrants themselves, especially the more vulnerable among them.

By November 2021 there were about 250 million confirmed cases globally and more than five million recorded deaths - though the actual death toll may be significantly higher. As the pandemic has spread it has stirred anxiety and snarled supply chains, overwhelmed health systems, and triggered potentially lasting geopolitical change. Vaccines have become widely-available in wealthier countries while others have mostly gone without, and half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the crisis. Around the world, desperate efforts are underway to fully contain what has become a profoundly disruptive outbreak.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Rebecca Katz, Director, Center for Global Health Science and Security, Ellie Graeden, Associate Professor (Adjunct), Alexandra Phelan, Assistant Professor, and Colin Carlson, Assistant Research Professor, at Georgetown University.",

As governments and businesses survey the damage inflicted by COVID-19, strategic foresight is more important than ever. Increasing social fragmentation and emerging risks to human health, rising unemployment, a widening digital divide, and youth disillusionment can have severe consequences. The gap between the haves and have nots will widen further if access to digital tools and skills remains unequal, and young people are now under exceptional pressure - many are facing their second global crisis in slightly more than a decade, and an elevated risk of missing out on opportunities. Yet, at a time when the breadth of global challenges demands collective action, fractures in the global community are at risk of widening further.",

As governments and businesses survey the damage inflicted by COVID-19, strategic foresight is more important than ever. Increasing social fragmentation and emerging risks to human health, rising unemployment, a widening digital divide, and youth disillusionment can have severe consequences. The gap between the haves and have nots will widen further if access to digital tools and skills remains unequal, and young people are now under exceptional pressure - many are facing their second global crisis in slightly more than a decade, and an elevated risk of missing out on opportunities. Yet, at a time when the breadth of global challenges demands collective action, fractures in the global community are at risk of widening further.",

The real estate market can be a source of instability, as in the case of housing bubbles, though environmentally-sustainable planning and the focused use of technological innovation can help foster healthier urban living, more responsible modes of transportation, and reduced emissions.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Andrew Baum, Head, Sara Tabone, Research Assistant, Fabian Braesemann, Research Fellow, Andy Saull, Affiliated Researcher, and Qizhou Xiong, Research Fellow, at the Oxford Future of Real Estate Initiative at Saïd Business School, University of Oxford.",

The content, including attached key issue headings and texts, is drawn from expert- and machine-curated knowledge on the World Economic Forum’s Strategic Intelligence platform; it is not a reproduction of the official text of the SDG. The UN introduces this Goal as follows:\n\n'Sustainable consumption and production is about promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. Its implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness and reduce poverty. At the current time, material consumption of natural resources is increasing, particularly within Eastern Asia. Countries are also continuing to address challenges regarding air, water and soil pollution. Since sustainable consumption and production aims at “doing more and better with less,” net welfare gains from economic activities can increase by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution along the whole life cycle, while increasing quality of life. There also needs to be significant focus on operating on supply chain, involving everyone from producer to final consumer. This includes educating consumers on sustainable consumption and lifestyles, providing them with adequate information through standards and labels and engaging in sustainable public procurement, among others.'",

By protecting forests, we will also be able to strengthen natural resource management and increase land productivity. At the current time, thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares. Even though up to 15% of land is currently under protection, biodiversity is still at risk. Deforestation and desertification – caused by human activities and climate change – pose major challenges to sustainable development and have affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in the fight against poverty. Efforts are being made to manage forests and combat desertification. There are two international agreements being implemented currently that promote the use of resources in an equitable way. Financial investments in support of biodiversity are also being provided.'",

The most vulnerable nations – the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing states – continue to make inroads into poverty reduction. However, inequality persists and large disparities remain regarding access to health and education services and other assets. There is growing consensus that economic growth is not sufﬁcient to reduce poverty if it is not inclusive and if it does not involve the three dimensions of sustainable development – economic, social and environmental. Fortunately, income inequality has been reduced both between and within countries. At the current time, the per capita income of 60 out of 94 countries with data has risen more rapidly than the national average. There has been some progress regarding creating favorable access conditions for exports from least developing countries as well. To reduce inequality, policies should be universal in principle, paying attention to the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized populations. There needs to be an increase in duty-free treatment and continuation of favoring exports from developing countries, in addition to increasing the share of developing countries’ vote within the IMF. Finally, innovations in technology can help reduce the cost of transferring money for migrant workers.'",

In order to make that happen, however, trillions will first have to be invested in the rollout of global 5G networks (which may be delayed in some cases due to COVID-19). Greater cooperation is needed to foster deployment; when used to power the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data, 5G can deliver significant social value. One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone. While several countries have initiated roadmaps for 5G rollout, others are falling behind - partly due to the lack of alignment among policy-makers, regulators and the private sector.",

Technological innovation is enabling greater insights and capabilities, and creating opportunities to more rapidly obtain accurate intelligence and evidence. However, the science applied within justice systems operates at a complex intersection of the law, governments, and communities - creating a dynamic and interconnected environment with diverse and sometimes competing interests. Better understanding this environment will be key for positively shaping justice systems.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Ruth Morgan, Professor of Crime and Forensic Sciences at University College London.",

In addition to helping people in places where crises were underway before the pandemic, humanitarian action must now also support public health responses - despite having long been faced with political threats, funding pressure, and bureaucratic barriers. More than 70 million people have been forcibly displaced by conflict and climate-related disasters, and current funding is inadequate to address their needs. However, a diverse cast of aid providers and funders is exploring new ways to reform ageing systems, address long-standing issues, and save more lives.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with The New Humanitarian, a non-profit news agency based in Geneva.",

Billions of people live without safe drinking water and sanitation, and severe tropical storms, drought, and the depletion of rivers and aquifers have displaced rural populations - forcing them into cities, or across international borders in ways that have impacted domestic politics in much of the world. Rural livelihoods often depend on agriculture, which accounts for roughly three-quarters of global freshwater withdrawals and generates nutrients that pollute watersheds in the world’s breadbaskets. These issues can be addressed with better planning and cooperation, and through increased investment, data analysis, and technological innovation.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with J.

Though traditionally centred on diplomacy and international organizations, a wide variety of public and private actors now engage in cross-border governance. The work itself has expanded well beyond treaty-making to include formal and informal monitoring, standard-setting, enforcement, and financing. Effective governance is essential to secure peaceful, healthy, and prosperous societies, particularly now amid COVID-19, worsening ecological crises, mounting geopolitical tension, and growing nationalist backlash against globalization.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

Plastics - whether soluble, disposable, or durable - cause pollution at almost every stage of their lifecycle, starting with the use of fossil fuels for their production. However, they are also essential for a cleaner and more sustainable future, thanks to practical applications ranging from water-purification to medical devices. New non-petrochemical feedstocks and materials, policies, and regulations are required in order to responsibly reduce plastic consumption and transition to a more circular plastics economy. Emerging technologies, such as chemical recycling, may accelerate this transformation.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Plastics, a collaboration of the Faculty of Law, Department of Chemistry and Smith School of Enterprise and Environment at the University of Oxford.",

The effects of air pollution are profound, and often under-recognized (though decreased mobility during COVID-19 provided a vivid glimpse of what's possible if the problem is properly addressed). The burden of pollution tends to be greater for poorer nations, and for marginalized groups in high-income countries. But the good news is that we can eliminate much of this pollution with existing technologies and practices, and at a surprisingly low cost - if we strategically invest in infrastructure, services, and incentives. Thanks to continuing advances in air pollution detection and analytics, we will increasingly have the intelligence necessary to drive positive change.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Dr. Jessica Seddon, Global Lead - Air Quality, and Dr. Beatriz Cardenas, Air Quality Director, at the World Resources Institute, and Jason West, Professor of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",

This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver both economic gains and more inclusive societies.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Mireia Giné, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, University of Navarra.",

A series of movements, policy proposals, and approved pieces of legislation around the world are pushing “green new deals” designed to slash emissions and foster greater sustainability. These efforts seek to create opportunities to dramatically curb carbon emissions, protect natural systems, and develop greenhouse gas removal technologies. Ultimately, the ideal net-zero policies, whether implemented in the public or the private sector, will include interventions that incentivize collaboration across institutions, as well as measures for these institutions to hold both one another and governments accountable. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Prof. Cameron Hepburn and researchers from both the Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and the Oxford Martin School.",

Current issues in the world of inclusive design that merit close attention include accessibility and disability, sustainability, human dignity, mental health, and the inclusiveness of cities.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution.",

While the term was first coined in 1990, geo-economic rivalries did not fully emerge until after the 2008 financial crisis.

Global stakeholders should think about how to best contain geo-economic tensions, in the interest of more effective international cooperation on matters like the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and migration.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Nicholas Mulder, Assistant Professor at Cornell University.",

As governments and businesses survey the damage inflicted by COVID-19, strategic foresight is more important than ever. Increasing social fragmentation and emerging risks to human health, rising unemployment, a widening digital divide, and youth disillusionment can have severe consequences. The gap between the haves and have nots will widen further if access to digital tools and skills remains unequal, and young people are now under exceptional pressure - many are facing their second global crisis in slightly more than a decade, and an elevated risk of missing out on opportunities. Yet, at a time when the breadth of global challenges demands collective action, fractures in the global community are at risk of widening further.",

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II.

In developed economies, distributed energy resources and digital technologies are transforming system planning and operations. These technologies are also creating opportunities to bring electricity to the more than 1.1 billion individuals who still lack access to an essential commodity. The threat of climate change has initiated a push for electricity decarbonization, and spurred efforts to electrify industry and transportation. Meanwhile efforts are underway to expand regional markets and create greater geographical interconnections, and to ensure the security of supply in the face of cyber threats and natural disasters. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Professor Ignacio Perez Arriaga (Director of Energy Training, Florence School of Regulation at the European University Institute; Visiting Professor at the Centre for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, MIT; and Professor and Director of the BP Chair of Energy and Sustainability at Comillas Pontifical University (ICADE)), and his team.",

Now, fully-fledged information and entertainment systems are sitting in just about everyone’s pocket. New approaches like quantum computing and artificial neurons promise to push performance and efficiency even further. However, technological progress has raised significant concerns related to our ability to protect both sensitive data and the environment - which can only be addressed with regulation designed to keep pace with innovation. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Dr. Thomas Monz, Senior Scientist at the University of Innsbruck.",

It is a new chapter in human development, enabled by advances that are commensurate with those of the first, second and third industrial revolutions - merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds and fusing technologies in ways that create both promise and peril. The speed, breadth, and depth of this revolution has forced us to rethink how countries should develop, how organizations create value, and how people from all walks of life can benefit from innovation.

For the roughly one billion people going without official proof of identity (and the more than three billion people unable to effectively use an identity on digital channels), collaborative and user-centric digital identity models guided by shared principles can be empowering.",

As governments and businesses survey the damage inflicted by COVID-19, strategic foresight is more important than ever. Increasing social fragmentation and emerging risks to human health, rising unemployment, a widening digital divide, and youth disillusionment can have severe consequences. The gap between the haves and have nots will widen further if access to digital tools and skills remains unequal, and young people are now under exceptional pressure - many are facing their second global crisis in slightly more than a decade, and an elevated risk of missing out on opportunities.

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver both economic gains and more inclusive societies.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Mireia Giné, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, University of Navarra.",

As the global economy rapidly digitalizes, an estimated 70% of new value created over the next decade will be based on digitally enabled platform business models. However, nearly half of the world’s population remains unconnected to the internet. While digital technologies have the potential to enable new value for everyone, they risk further exacerbating exclusion, the unequal concentration of power and wealth, and social instability. Companies must use digital infrastructure and data to collaborate, develop innovative business models, navigate disruption, and transition to a new normal - post-pandemic, purpose-driven, sustainable, and inclusive.",

The European Union mustered a comprehensive pandemic response that included an unprecedented economic recovery effort, a largely successful vaccination campaign, significant contributions to global vaccine access, and increased coordination of health resources and policies. Now, that response may accelerate the EU’s social, digital, and green transition. Yet, challenges abound - defence cooperation has yet to translate into increased capacity, Europe’s position amid growing great power competition remains unsettled, its institutions are being forced to defend democracy in the face of rising populism, and migration requires a more comprehensive approach. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Alexander Stubb, Director, Fabrizio Tassinari, Executive Director, George Papaconstantinou, Professor, and Jonas Brendebach, Research Associate, at the School of Transnational Governance of the European University Institute.",

Best-known as the digital underpinning of Bitcoin, it has evolved into a foundational technology with promise in many areas. While the financial sector is investigating it as a means to replace expensive and inefficient payment systems, it could also reshape supply chains - particularly in combination with the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence - while boosting the practical, day-to-day use of smart contracts and digital identities. However, many questions remain about the best use of the technology, its environmental impact, and its governance.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Dr. Kibae Kim, Principal Researcher at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).",

Current issues in the world of inclusive design that merit close attention include accessibility and disability, sustainability, human dignity, mental health, and the inclusiveness of cities.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution.",

At the same time there has also been an increase in top-down forms of civic participation - where the political system itself provides processes like citizens’ juries, participatory budgeting, and referendums. Overall, a general dilution of hierarchies is underway amid growing tension between the local and the global - as digitalization reshuffles the traditional logic of power. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Antoine Vergne, Director of Strategic Partnerships at Missions Publiques",

Nearly a third of the global population lacks access to clean water, global warming is creating deadlier weather patterns, hundreds of millions of children are being deprived of access to education, and income inequality is on the rise as some 3.4 billion people are forced to live on less than $5.50 a day. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement provide an architecture for addressing these challenges, by fundamentally shifting the ways that societies produce, consume, and operate. Realizing related opportunities to pursue the Sustainable Development agenda, however, will require closer cooperation between the public and private sectors.",

As the fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate people, organizations, and communities, they provide a basis for social justice and belief in necessary institutions. They also express personal and collective judgments about what is important - influenced by culture, religion, and laws. Values can potentially spur purposeful action aimed at increasing equality, decreasing harm to the environment, and improving global health.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Veronica Vecchi, Associate Professor of Practice of Government, Health and Not for Profit at Bocconi University School of Management, along with colleagues.",

Collaboration among businesses, the government, and civil society that cuts across boundaries is essential for social enterprises to increase the scale of their impact. These enterprises can be non-profits like First Book, which provides books for children in need, or for-profits that embed a social mission in their business, like outdoor clothing company Patagonia. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Vanina Farber, Professor and elea Chair for Social Innovation, IMD Business School.",

However, globalization has pressured tax systems and caused a shift in tax burden from the richest to the poorest. Some 40% of the profits earned by multinational corporations are moved to tax havens every year, at a cost of about $200 billion to public coffers. And, one quarter of the taxes owed by the wealthiest 0.01% of people are never paid, as assets are stashed offshore. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, sufficient and stable tax revenue is necessary. Taxing carbon emissions could meanwhile help curb global warming, and tax hikes may actually bolster inclusive growth if spent appropriately. A smartly-reformed tax system can embrace globalization, as it delivers shared and sustainable prosperity. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Ludvig Wier, postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and founder of Economists Without Borders.",

While bribery is the most common, electoral fraud, cronyism, state capture, and embezzlement can all have deleterious effects on society. There is no single definition that can adequately capture all the manifestations of corruption, and there has been a paradigm shift in terms of the fight against it - which takes place increasingly through multi-stakeholder collaboration, collective action initiatives specific to particular sectors, the use of new technology, a more expansive “stakeholder” approach to capitalism, better assessing gender implications, and elevating public awareness. Fighting corruption in all of its forms will be essential for truly sustainable development.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and is curated in partnership with Pawan Kumar Sinha, Director of Academic Programmes at the International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA).",

This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value.

However, globalization has pressured tax systems and caused a shift in tax burden from the richest to the poorest. Some 40% of the profits earned by multinational corporations are moved to tax havens every year, at a cost of about $200 billion to public coffers. And, one quarter of the taxes owed by the wealthiest 0.01% of people are never paid, as assets are stashed offshore. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, sufficient and stable tax revenue is necessary. Taxing carbon emissions could meanwhile help curb global warming, and tax hikes may actually bolster inclusive growth if spent appropriately.

By November 2021 there were about 250 million confirmed cases globally and more than five million recorded deaths - though the actual death toll may be significantly higher. As the pandemic has spread it has stirred anxiety and snarled supply chains, overwhelmed health systems, and triggered potentially lasting geopolitical change. Vaccines have become widely-available in wealthier countries while others have mostly gone without, and half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the crisis. Around the world, desperate efforts are underway to fully contain what has become a profoundly disruptive outbreak.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Rebecca Katz, Director, Center for Global Health Science and Security, Ellie Graeden, Associate Professor (Adjunct), Alexandra Phelan, Assistant Professor, and Colin Carlson, Assistant Research Professor, at Georgetown University.",

One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone.

One key underlying factor has been the increased prevalence since the 1970s of neoliberalism and the financialization of everything - resulting in a de-democratization of economic policy-making. Yet, inequality is not solely about income; inequalities in terms of health, age, (dis)ability, gender, technology access, infrastructure, and geographical location have all been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitigating inequality will now demand a mix of bottom-up and top-down changes that recognize the social and economic systems aggravating inequality are a matter of choice.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Professor Henrietta L.

Building future-ready (and pandemic-proof) education systems requires curricula fit for the 21st century, coupled with the consistent delivery of widely-accessible instruction that builds a solid foundation for a lifetime of adapting and developing new abilities. Specialized education should focus in particular on skills that are in demand in the real world, and address the disconnect between employer needs and available talent pools.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Prof. Dr. Isabell M.

However, globalization has pressured tax systems and caused a shift in tax burden from the richest to the poorest. Some 40% of the profits earned by multinational corporations are moved to tax havens every year, at a cost of about $200 billion to public coffers. And, one quarter of the taxes owed by the wealthiest 0.01% of people are never paid, as assets are stashed offshore. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, sufficient and stable tax revenue is necessary. Taxing carbon emissions could meanwhile help curb global warming, and tax hikes may actually bolster inclusive growth if spent appropriately. A smartly-reformed tax system can embrace globalization, as it delivers shared and sustainable prosperity. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Ludvig Wier, postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and founder of Economists Without Borders.",

As the pandemic has spread it has stirred anxiety and snarled supply chains, overwhelmed health systems, and triggered potentially lasting geopolitical change. Vaccines have become widely-available in wealthier countries while others have mostly gone without, and half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the crisis. Around the world, desperate efforts are underway to fully contain what has become a profoundly disruptive outbreak.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Rebecca Katz, Director, Center for Global Health Science and Security, Ellie Graeden, Associate Professor (Adjunct), Alexandra Phelan, Assistant Professor, and Colin Carlson, Assistant Research Professor, at Georgetown University.",

This applies both during periods of relative stability, and during crises - when many organizations will be forced to confront how well they have or have not prepared from a corporate governance standpoint. Good governance relies on internal mechanisms like the structure of a board and incentives for management, and on external mechanisms such as institutions that demand accountability. All of these mechanisms are important, as they form the core of how (and for whom) corporations generate value. Ultimately, corporate governance can help deliver both economic gains and more inclusive societies.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Mireia Giné, Associate Professor, IESE Business School, University of Navarra.",

While bribery is the most common, electoral fraud, cronyism, state capture, and embezzlement can all have deleterious effects on society. There is no single definition that can adequately capture all the manifestations of corruption, and there has been a paradigm shift in terms of the fight against it - which takes place increasingly through multi-stakeholder collaboration, collective action initiatives specific to particular sectors, the use of new technology, a more expansive “stakeholder” approach to capitalism, better assessing gender implications, and elevating public awareness. Fighting corruption in all of its forms will be essential for truly sustainable development.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and is curated in partnership with Pawan Kumar Sinha, Director of Academic Programmes at the International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA).",

In order to make that happen, however, trillions will first have to be invested in the rollout of global 5G networks (which may be delayed in some cases due to COVID-19). Greater cooperation is needed to foster deployment; when used to power the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data, 5G can deliver significant social value. One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone. While several countries have initiated roadmaps for 5G rollout, others are falling behind - partly due to the lack of alignment among policy-makers, regulators and the private sector.",

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement provide an architecture for addressing these challenges, by fundamentally shifting the ways that societies produce, consume, and operate.

In order to make that happen, however, trillions will first have to be invested in the rollout of global 5G networks (which may be delayed in some cases due to COVID-19). Greater cooperation is needed to foster deployment; when used to power the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data, 5G can deliver significant social value. One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone. While several countries have initiated roadmaps for 5G rollout, others are falling behind - partly due to the lack of alignment among policy-makers, regulators and the private sector.",

More sustainable production and operation of air- and spacecraft is also anticipated, and space access is becoming more affordable thanks to reusable rockets and miniaturized technology.

However, globalization has pressured tax systems and caused a shift in tax burden from the richest to the poorest. Some 40% of the profits earned by multinational corporations are moved to tax havens every year, at a cost of about $200 billion to public coffers. And, one quarter of the taxes owed by the wealthiest 0.01% of people are never paid, as assets are stashed offshore. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, sufficient and stable tax revenue is necessary. Taxing carbon emissions could meanwhile help curb global warming, and tax hikes may actually bolster inclusive growth if spent appropriately. A smartly-reformed tax system can embrace globalization, as it delivers shared and sustainable prosperity. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Ludvig Wier, postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and founder of Economists Without Borders.",

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

The European Union mustered a comprehensive pandemic response that included an unprecedented economic recovery effort, a largely successful vaccination campaign, significant contributions to global vaccine access, and increased coordination of health resources and policies. Now, that response may accelerate the EU’s social, digital, and green transition. Yet, challenges abound - defence cooperation has yet to translate into increased capacity, Europe’s position amid growing great power competition remains unsettled, its institutions are being forced to defend democracy in the face of rising populism, and migration requires a more comprehensive approach. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Alexander Stubb, Director, Fabrizio Tassinari, Executive Director, George Papaconstantinou, Professor, and Jonas Brendebach, Research Associate, at the School of Transnational Governance of the European University Institute.",

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

Now, that response may accelerate the EU’s social, digital, and green transition.

Through growth in their domestic markets and a combination of greenfield investments, mergers, and acquisitions - including in more developed regions - they have become industry leaders.

The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

However, globalization has pressured tax systems and caused a shift in tax burden from the richest to the poorest. Some 40% of the profits earned by multinational corporations are moved to tax havens every year, at a cost of about $200 billion to public coffers. And, one quarter of the taxes owed by the wealthiest 0.01% of people are never paid, as assets are stashed offshore. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, sufficient and stable tax revenue is necessary. Taxing carbon emissions could meanwhile help curb global warming, and tax hikes may actually bolster inclusive growth if spent appropriately. A smartly-reformed tax system can embrace globalization, as it delivers shared and sustainable prosperity. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Ludvig Wier, postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and founder of Economists Without Borders.",

Vaccines have become widely-available in wealthier countries while others have mostly gone without, and half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the crisis.

The European Union mustered a comprehensive pandemic response that included an unprecedented economic recovery effort, a largely successful vaccination campaign, significant contributions to global vaccine access, and increased coordination of health resources and policies. Now, that response may accelerate the EU’s social, digital, and green transition. Yet, challenges abound - defence cooperation has yet to translate into increased capacity, Europe’s position amid growing great power competition remains unsettled, its institutions are being forced to defend democracy in the face of rising populism, and migration requires a more comprehensive approach. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Alexander Stubb, Director, Fabrizio Tassinari, Executive Director, George Papaconstantinou, Professor, and Jonas Brendebach, Research Associate, at the School of Transnational Governance of the European University Institute.",

                        "description": "Geopolitics has changed dramatically since the end of the Cold War. The economic growth of countries in the Global South - and of China in particular - has challenged the dominance of the West. At the same time, nationalism and populism have shifted some countries’ foreign policy objectives away from cooperation. In an increasingly multipolar and multi-conceptual world, singular ideas about how best to look after global affairs have been replaced by a diffusion of power and political values. This fractured landscape calls into question alliances and multilateral institutions that have been cornerstones of the global order since World War II. It also risks undermining humanity’s ability to respond to pressing global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and the impacts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Thomas Hale, Associate Professor in Public Policy (Global Public Policy), Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.",

In order to make that happen, however, trillions will first have to be invested in the rollout of global 5G networks (which may be delayed in some cases due to COVID-19). Greater cooperation is needed to foster deployment; when used to power the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data, 5G can deliver significant social value. One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone. While several countries have initiated roadmaps for 5G rollout, others are falling behind - partly due to the lack of alignment among policy-makers, regulators and the private sector.",

One key underlying factor has been the increased prevalence since the 1970s of neoliberalism and the financialization of everything - resulting in a de-democratization of economic policy-making. Yet, inequality is not solely about income; inequalities in terms of health, age, (dis)ability, gender, technology access, infrastructure, and geographical location have all been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mitigating inequality will now demand a mix of bottom-up and top-down changes that recognize the social and economic systems aggravating inequality are a matter of choice.\n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Professor Henrietta L.

The European Union mustered a comprehensive pandemic response that included an unprecedented economic recovery effort, a largely successful vaccination campaign, significant contributions to global vaccine access, and increased coordination of health resources and policies. Now, that response may accelerate the EU’s social, digital, and green transition. Yet, challenges abound - defence cooperation has yet to translate into increased capacity, Europe’s position amid growing great power competition remains unsettled, its institutions are being forced to defend democracy in the face of rising populism, and migration requires a more comprehensive approach. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Alexander Stubb, Director, Fabrizio Tassinari, Executive Director, George Papaconstantinou, Professor, and Jonas Brendebach, Research Associate, at the School of Transnational Governance of the European University Institute.",

As the global economy rapidly digitalizes, an estimated 70% of new value created over the next decade will be based on digitally enabled platform business models. However, nearly half of the world’s population remains unconnected to the internet. While digital technologies have the potential to enable new value for everyone, they risk further exacerbating exclusion, the unequal concentration of power and wealth, and social instability. Companies must use digital infrastructure and data to collaborate, develop innovative business models, navigate disruption, and transition to a new normal - post-pandemic, purpose-driven, sustainable, and inclusive.",

In order to make that happen, however, trillions will first have to be invested in the rollout of global 5G networks (which may be delayed in some cases due to COVID-19). Greater cooperation is needed to foster deployment; when used to power the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and big data, 5G can deliver significant social value. One study indicated that it will support hundreds of thousands of jobs in Switzerland (population 8.5 million) alone. While several countries have initiated roadmaps for 5G rollout, others are falling behind - partly due to the lack of alignment among policy-makers, regulators and the private sector.",

The European Union mustered a comprehensive pandemic response that included an unprecedented economic recovery effort, a largely successful vaccination campaign, significant contributions to global vaccine access, and increased coordination of health resources and policies. Now, that response may accelerate the EU’s social, digital, and green transition. Yet, challenges abound - defence cooperation has yet to translate into increased capacity, Europe’s position amid growing great power competition remains unsettled, its institutions are being forced to defend democracy in the face of rising populism, and migration requires a more comprehensive approach. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Alexander Stubb, Director, Fabrizio Tassinari, Executive Director, George Papaconstantinou, Professor, and Jonas Brendebach, Research Associate, at the School of Transnational Governance of the European University Institute.",

By November 2021 there were about 250 million confirmed cases globally and more than five million recorded deaths - though the actual death toll may be significantly higher. As the pandemic has spread it has stirred anxiety and snarled supply chains, overwhelmed health systems, and triggered potentially lasting geopolitical change. Vaccines have become widely-available in wealthier countries while others have mostly gone without, and half a billion people could be pushed into poverty as a result of the crisis.

As the global economy rapidly digitalizes, an estimated 70% of new value created over the next decade will be based on digitally enabled platform business models. However, nearly half of the world’s population remains unconnected to the internet. While digital technologies have the potential to enable new value for everyone, they risk further exacerbating exclusion, the unequal concentration of power and wealth, and social instability. Companies must use digital infrastructure and data to collaborate, develop innovative business models, navigate disruption, and transition to a new normal - post-pandemic, purpose-driven, sustainable, and inclusive.",

Yet, challenges abound - defence cooperation has yet to translate into increased capacity, Europe’s position amid growing great power competition remains unsettled, its institutions are being forced to defend democracy in the face of rising populism, and migration requires a more comprehensive approach. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Alexander Stubb, Director, Fabrizio Tassinari, Executive Director, George Papaconstantinou, Professor, and Jonas Brendebach, Research Associate, at the School of Transnational Governance of the European University Institute.",

Now, fully-fledged information and entertainment systems are sitting in just about everyone’s pocket. New approaches like quantum computing and artificial neurons promise to push performance and efficiency even further. However, technological progress has raised significant concerns related to our ability to protect both sensitive data and the environment - which can only be addressed with regulation designed to keep pace with innovation. \n\nThis briefing is based on the views of a wide range of experts from the World Economic Forum’s Expert Network and is curated in partnership with Dr. Thomas Monz, Senior Scientist at the University of Innsbruck.",
